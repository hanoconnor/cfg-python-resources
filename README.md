# CFG Python: Useful Resource Links Repo

<p>I have curated this list of useful resource links during my time as a Lead Instructor teaching the course. I decided to save the list to a repo, so students can continue to have access to them following completion of the course and for fellow CFG instructors to use. Hope it helps.</p>

<p>You can 'Star' to save the repo or just bookmark the link for future easy access to the resources if you have found this list useful. Please do report any broken links and I shall fix or add a suitable alternative as soon as possible.</p>
